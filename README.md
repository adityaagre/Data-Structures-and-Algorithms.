I use this repository to keep records of algorithms or problems or any concepts that I found interesting.

We have lots of data structure implementations, searching, sorting algorithms, etc.
Programs on #Recursion, #Greedy_approach, #Divide_n_conquer, #Dynamic_programming, etc.

I also add challenging problems from leetcode and codechef.

Will add more!!

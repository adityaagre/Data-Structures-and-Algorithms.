I use this repository to keep records of algorithms or problems or any concepts that I found interesting.

We have lots of data structure implementations, searching, sorting algorithms, etc.
Programs on Recursion, Mathematical_algos., Greedy_approach, Divide_n_conquer, Dynamic_programming, Object Oriented Programming, etc.

I also add challenging problems from leetcode and codechef.

Will add more!!
